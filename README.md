# Leetcode Daily Problems

In this repository, I’ve gathered all my solutions to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. While these solutions are available on my [Leetcode Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/mariabalos16/), I wanted a central space to organize and showcase my work on GitHub.

I began solving Leetcode problems in June 2024, aiming to enhance my coding skills and improve in Python. Since then, I’ve been working to solve at least five problems weekly.

# Milestones
- Solved close to 200 problems, primarily in the "Easy" category, with a gradual shift toward "Medium."
- Improved my Leetcode ranking from 1,091,491 to 535,959 – a journey of steady progress.
- Maintained an 80% acceptance rate for the first two months, which later settled to 72% as I took on the more challenging daily problems.
- Developed a broad set of foundational, intermediate, and advanced skills, which you can explore in my [Leetcode profile](https://lnkd.in/eJyWMSrY).
- Overcoming the frustration of being stuck and learning strategies to find solutions.
- Gained confidence and research skills, reducing the intimidation of unfamiliar programming challenges.
